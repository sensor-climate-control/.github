## Project Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to empower homeowners to make optimal use of their windows to cool and heat their homes, using sensors placed throughout their home.

Annually, the cost of air conditioning and heating equipment rises in cost anywhere from 5% - 9%. Coupled with the growing costs of electricity and natural gas, in-house climate control can amass enormous utility bills. Effective use of the windows in oneâ€™s home can help, but knowing how best to use the windows in your home is a non-trivial problem.
